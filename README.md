# Hello-World
First GitHub
This is the area where we will put our changes.  Nice to see what and how this works.  So far so good.
This will take a little expermentation to figure out but overall pretty straigh forward.
Here is a third commit

Not sure why it did not grab the rest of line on third commit about 4th commit.
This is a test of a local repo change.

Here is a second local commit before the Pull Request.

Here is the file from second computer.  Little confused because I am not sure where the Git directory ended up because it is not here.

It went right into the Master, not sure why.
